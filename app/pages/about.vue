        <p>
          I bring web ideas to life from the sunny South Coast, operating within
          Brighton's dynamic tech scene. As a Web Developer, I focus on
          delivering
          <strong>impactful and robust digital experiences</strong> by mastering
          a diverse set of technologies, including
          <strong>HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript/JQuery, and Liquid</strong>.
          My expertise lies in crafting bespoke
          <strong>WordPress and Shopify</strong> solutions, complemented by
          growing knowledge in
          <strong>Laravel, React/NextJS, and Sanity</strong> CMS. I'm also
          currently exploring 3D with <strong>ThreeJS</strong>, always expanding
          my capabilities.
        </p>

          Collaboration is at the heart of how I work, ensuring every project
          truly transforms initial concepts into robust web solutions. My
          passion extends to the creative side, where I love to tinker with CSS
          animations and explore <strong>generative art</strong>. With solid
          <strong>server management</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong>
          skills, I ensure every digital environment is not just functional, but
          secure. My journey, deeply supported by the Brighton dev community,
          began in 2017, and I've been building and learning ever since.
