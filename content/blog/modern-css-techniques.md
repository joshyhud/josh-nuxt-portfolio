# Modern CSS Techniques for Better UX

CSS has evolved tremendously over the past few years. Let's explore some modern techniques that can significantly improve user experience.

## CSS Grid: The Layout Revolution

CSS Grid has revolutionized how we approach layout design:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

This creates a responsive grid that automatically adjusts to screen size.

## Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

CSS variables make theming and maintenance much easier:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
}

.button {
  background: var(--primary-color);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
  padding: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 2);
}
```

## Container Queries

Container queries allow components to respond to their container size:

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Modern CSS provides powerful tools for creating responsive, maintainable, and beautiful interfaces. Embrace these techniques to build better user experiences.
