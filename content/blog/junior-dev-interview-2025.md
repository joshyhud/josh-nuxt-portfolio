Back in 2017, I interviewed for my very first junior web developer role.  
I was _bricking it_ — convinced I’d be grilled with whiteboard coding challenges, obscure technical questions, and logic puzzles that would make Einstein sweat.

But the reality? Very different.

### **It was more conversation than quiz**

Instead of a gauntlet of technical tests, most of the interview was a friendly conversation about:

- What the company does
- What they were looking for
- What I wanted in a role
- Who I was beyond the CV

As a junior developer, they already knew I had a lot to learn. They were more interested in whether I’d be a good fit for the team and whether I had the curiosity and drive to grow.

### **Honesty was my superpower**

I told them where I was in my coding journey — from my previous career in a call centre to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own.  
I made it clear what I _did_ know, but also what I _didn’t_.

The key?  
If you don’t know something, say so — but follow it with _“I’m happy to learn”_.  
I even made notes during the interview about unfamiliar topics so I could research them later.

Lying or bluffing about technical knowledge? That’s a boomerang — it _will_ come back to hit you.

### **Remember: an interview is two-way**

It’s not just for them to evaluate you — you’re also evaluating them.  
Ask questions about:

- How they work day-to-day
- Their culture
- What “success” looks like in the role

You have as much right to interview _them_ as they do you.

### **Be prepared, but stay human**

I had very few technical questions, but I still recommend:

- Brushing up on core concepts
- Preparing examples of things you’ve built or learned recently
- Sharing side projects (even if unrelated to the role)

And don’t underestimate the value of finding shared interests — my interviewer loved board games, so we geeked out about that for a bit. It broke the ice and made the whole experience more relaxed.

### **Rejection isn’t the end**

Sometimes you’ll get the job, sometimes you won’t. Either way:

- Ask for feedback
- Don’t take it personally (easier said than done, I know)
- Remember: if they invited you to interview, you’re already doing something right

**Losing is sometimes winning.** The experience you gain now can land you the _next_ role.

**2025 Note:**  
Today’s junior dev interviews can be more technical than mine was — online coding tests, take-home projects, and live problem-solving are more common. But the fundamentals still apply:  
Be honest  
Show curiosity  
Ask smart questions  
Connect as a human, not just a résumé
