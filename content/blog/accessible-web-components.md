# Building Accessible Web Components

Accessibility should be a fundamental consideration in every web development project. Here's how to build components that work for everyone.

## The Importance of Semantic HTML

Start with proper semantic HTML elements:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<button type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menu">Menu</button>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div onclick="toggleMenu()">Menu</div>
```

## ARIA Attributes

ARIA attributes provide context for assistive technologies:

- `aria-label`: Provides an accessible name
- `aria-describedby`: References descriptive text
- `aria-live`: Announces dynamic content changes

## Focus Management

Ensure keyboard navigation works properly:

```css
.button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #007bff;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Color and Contrast

Maintain sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

## Testing Your Components

- Use screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Navigate with keyboard only
- Check color contrast ratios
- Validate with accessibility tools

Building accessible components isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about creating inclusive experiences for all users.
