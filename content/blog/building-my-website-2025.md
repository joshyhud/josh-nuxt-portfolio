Back in late 2020, after _months_ of procrastinating (and telling myself I was “researching”), I finally built my new personal website.  
I’d been working mainly in WordPress at my day job, but for my own site, I wanted something lighter, faster, and less “bulky CMS.” That’s when I discovered **Gatsby**.

### **Why gatsby won me over**

At the time, Gatsby’s docs were some of the clearest I’d ever seen — they could walk you through making a site for cute panda videos and you’d feel like a React wizard by the end.  
Because I’d already done some beginner React work, the syntax felt familiar. But even without that, Gatsby made it approachable.

I loved:

- Building pages from simple Markdown files
- Programmatically generating blog posts
- The speed and smoothness of the final site

Compared to my old site, the new one felt clean, professional, and _mine_.

### **Fast-forward to 2025**

The web ecosystem hasn’t slowed down. While Gatsby is still around, I’ve since transitioned my site to **Nuxt 4** with **Vue**. This shift wasn’t just about trying something new, it was about finding a framework that better aligned with my current workflow and goals. Hosting has also evolved; I now use **GitHub Pages**, which integrates seamlessly with my development process.

Key lessons I’ve learned since 2020:

1. **Pick a tool that fits the project** — not just what’s trending.
2. **Keep content portable** — Markdown (and now MD) means I can switch frameworks without losing everything.
3. **Performance matters** — Lighthouse scores aren’t just vanity; they affect SEO, accessibility, and user experience.
4. **Automate deployments** — GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages means updates happen in minutes, not hours.

### **Why my website still matters**

In that 2017 interview I shared in my “Junior Developer Interview” post, I talked about the importance of showing passion projects. This website has been my ongoing example a living portfolio that reflects both my skills and my growth.

When I apply for roles or collaborate on projects, I can point to it and say:

> “Here’s what I’ve built, here’s how I’ve maintained it, and here’s what I’ve learned along the way.”

### **Looking ahead**

I still tinker with the site — swapping components, testing design tweaks, adding posts like this one. It’s my little corner of the web where I control the narrative and the code.

If there’s one thing I’d tell anyone thinking about building their own dev site in 2025, it’s this:

- Start simple.
- Make it _yours_.
- Let it evolve as you do.

Because your portfolio isn’t just a website — it’s a conversation starter.
